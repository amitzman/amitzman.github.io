**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that margin is the space around the element.  The larger the margin then the more space between the element and elements around.  Then border is the edge around an element.  Padding is the spacing between the content and the border.  We can adjust this value to move the border closer or further from the content.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned about the four position values for the position property.  Static, relative, fixed and absolute. HTML elements are positioned static by default and they are positioned according to the normal flow of the page.  HTML elements that are positioned relative is positioned to its normal position.  HTML elements that are positioned fixed always stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled down or up.  If an HTML is positioned absolute then it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The aspects I found the easiest were changing the sizes of fonts and changing colors of fonts and backgrounds.  Positioning was a little more difficult for me, just a lot of trial and error when messing with the padding and margins.  It wasn’t too bad since I don’t have a lot of content on my site though.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that styling can be added to elements by three ways.  The first way is Inline by using a style attribute.  Example: <p style= “color:blue;”>.  The second way is internal by using a <style> element in the head section.  <style> p {color:blue;} </style>.  Then the last way is using an external css file which is just linked in the head of the html file.
