<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was great.  It's always good to get another person's point of view.  My partner came up with some great ideas that I didn't think of. For instance my partner had a great suggestion on a better way to display archived blog posts by doing a sidebar.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Found it very helpful.  It became easier for me to start writing HTML for it.  Wireframing makes me more efficient since I already have a map for how I want my site to look then I already have an idea of what elements I will need to be using from the beginning.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided a good wireframe should be simple, consistent and concise.  When it is simple, it makes it more easier to navigate and find things.  By keeping it consistent and concise it makes it more readable and unsterandable for others looking at it.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

While researching on w3schools.com, I learned about the <article> element.  The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content which can be used for Blog posts.
