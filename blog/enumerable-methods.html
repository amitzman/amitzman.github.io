        What a difference a week makes.  Felt like we went from 0 to 60 real fast in Ruby.  This week was full of very difficult challenges that I spent most of my time sifting through the Ruby Docs researching methods and enumerables.  Enumerables are ways to search, sort and manipulate data and are very helpful when it comes to refactoring code.  One of the more popular enumerable I used was map.  Below are a couple of examples that show how to use map and how it works.
      </p>
      <p>In this first example, I have an array of numbers.  I decided that I want to multiply each number by five, so I used the .map! enumerable on my array.  The first of the structure takes each element (which I called “num”) then for the block of code I have the element being multiplied by five.  Then you can see the array with new values multiplied by five.  In this instance, I called the destructive method of map by using an !.  So this means when I call map!, it will modify my_array itself instead of creating a new array.</p>

      <p>In this next example, I use map again, but the non destructive form.  For this one I had an array of greetings.  I decided I wanted to personalize the array so I called the map enumerable to add my name to each greeting.  It has the same set up as the previous example.  The biggest difference is that when I call my array, it doesn’t have the modification.  This is because the non destructive map creates a brand new array and doesn’t modify the original.</p>
