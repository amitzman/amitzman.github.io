    <h1>Onto JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>More Loops!</h2>
    <h4>December 6th, 2015</h4>

    <article>
      <p>
        Another week down and one step closer to Phase-1.  This week we started digging into the language of JavaScript.  It was very similar to Ruby fundamental wise, but syntax wise very different.  The one thing that stayed the same this week was that there was still plenty of looping to be done.
      </p>
      <p>I would say the biggest difference is that Ruby is more implicit and JavaScript is more explicit when it comes to looping.  Below is an example of a loop in JavaScript and one in Ruby that result to the same thing.  The most frequently used JavaScript loop I used this week was a for loop and the most frequently used Ruby loop was the .each do. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/loop1.png" height = 80px>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/loop2.png" height = 80px>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/loop3.png" height = 80px>
      </figure>
      <p>For JavaScript, the starting point is defined by using ‘var i = 0’, in this case we use it as the index for the array.  Then the break in the loop is defined with ‘i < myArray.length’ which tells the loop to stop once i is no longer less than the length of the array (5).  Then lastly, the increment is defined by using i++, which says to increase i by one.</p>

      <p>Whereas for Ruby, the .each do iterator implies that it will start from the beginning, end once each element has been iterated, and increment by one.  Even though there might be more syntax to the JavaScript loop, I feel like I have more control when it comes to creating the loop as opposed to the .each in Ruby.</p>
