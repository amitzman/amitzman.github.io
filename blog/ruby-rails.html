    <h2>The Best Web Framework</h2>

        During Phase-0 we’ve spent a great deal learning and using Ruby.  We’ve learned that Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.  We’ve been able to create some cool functions and doing lots of iterations, but we yet to translate all of that code into an actual web application which is where Ruby on Rails comes in.

        <h3>What is Rails?</h3>
      <p>Rails is a web application framework that is written in Ruby, which is how they coined the name Ruby on Rails. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. The main advantage of Ruby on Rails framework is considered to be the speed of development. Some popular sites that have been built on Rails are, Airbnb, Github and Bleacher Report</p>
      <p>It has been shown that the speed of development in Rails is increased by 30-40% in relation to any other programming language or framework.  This is because of the main philosophy of Rails which have two major guidelines: </p>
      <p>One is Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) and the other is Convention Over Configuration (CoC). An example of CoC from wikipedia, if there is a class Sale in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called sales by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table "products sold", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names.
</p>
      <p>Rails is based on <strong>Modal View Controller(MVC)</strong>. The MVC pattern proposes three main components or objects to be used in software development:</p>

      <p><strong>A Model</strong>, which represents the underlying, logical structure of data in a software application and the high-level class associated with it. This object model does not contain any information about the user interface.<br>
<strong>A View</strong>, which is a collection of classes representing the elements in the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes, and so forth)<br>
<strong>A Controller</strong>, which represents the classes connecting the model and the view, and is used to communicate between classes in the model and view.</p>

<p>Here is a video which helped me get a little bit better understanding of how it all works.</p>
